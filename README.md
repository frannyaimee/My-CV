## Context: 

This was an exercise given by BeCode to create a Resume page online. This was the 8th and final exercise out of the first 8 exercises we were given. It is a simple one page website with my education and work history as well as my current status. I also have my social media/linked-in linked on the page, as well as some personal info such as my phone number and email address. I also gave a little snippet of my coding and language skills.
##  Status: 

Completed

## Installation:

No Installation needed, I coded this website in Sublime Text and wrote everything using HTML and CSS. I added a CSS animation to the background which causes the website to require quite some energy to load.
