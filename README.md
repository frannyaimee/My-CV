## Context: 

This was an exercise given by BeCode to create a Resume page online. This was the 8th and final exercise out of the first 8 exercises we were given. It is a simple one page website with my education and work history as well as my current status. I also have my social media/linked-in linked on the page, as well as some personal info such as my phone number and email address. I also gave a little snippet of my coding and language skills.

## Instructions
* Read this article and tutorial on grids in design
* Create a GitHub repository "My-CV"
* Create (in HTML & CSS) a resume (CV) page
* Use CSS Grid to align the content of the resume as you would for a classical one (Example)
* Make sure the CV is completely responsive (!)
* Deploy it online with (GitHub Pages)
* How to make sure the CV is responsive:
* On any screen size, all the content is readable and ordered in an efficient way
* Your picture becomes full sized on mobile screens
* The text size changes depending on screen size
* No huge margins in between content blocks
* Make sure it looks good on any screen!

##  Status: 

Completed

## Installation:

No Installation needed, I coded this website in Sublime Text and wrote everything using HTML and CSS. I added a CSS animation to the background which causes the website to require quite some energy to load.
